	Package ratelimiter

	This package provides a rate limiter middleware using the "Leaky bucket"
	algorithm's "meter" variant.

	The idea is that the bucket "fills" every time a request is received. If the
	bucket would overflow, then the middleware blocks the request by sending a
	a 429 Too Many Requests status with a Retry-After header. The delay here
	contains a random component to make sure that all clients don't come back
	at the same time in case of a peaky load.

	A background process periodically "leaks" the bucket, so new requests can
	come through.
